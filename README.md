# Comedian

   THIS IS A SIMPLE JAVA PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE:
   
      -ENCAPSULATION, 
      
      -POLYMORPHISM THROUGH INHERITANCE
      
      -GENERICS 
      
      -AND COLLECTIONS IN JAVA
      
  IT ' S ABOUT A BOT, A COMEDIAN, A COMEDIAN BOT,  A JOKEWRITER, and JOKES. The comedian can say a Joke and tell a randome Joke from his repertoire of Jokes written by the Joke writer. Not so smart a comedian. He cannot even write his own jokes.
